# deployment to production

This api is currently used at https://api.radio4000.com

It is currently setup on **vercel to autodeploy with new comits to
this github repository**.

Otherwise (when `cd` in the folder):

- dev: =now .=
- production: =now . --prod=

# local build

To run a local dev server with the api:

- =now dev=

# Radio4000 API

In two parts, node js endpoints & firebase/cloudinary

## Custom endpoints (node + vercel)

|URL|Description|
|--------|-------|
|https://api.radio4000.com/embed?slug={channelSlug}|Returns an HTML embed with the [radio4000-player](https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000-player)|
|https://api.radio4000.com/oembed?slug={channelSlug}|Returns a `JSON` object following the [oEmbed spec](http://oembed.com/) for a Radio4000 channel. With this, we can add a meta tag to each channel to get rich previews when the link is shared.|
|https://api.radio4000.com/backup?slug={channelSlug}|Returns a full JSON export of a channel|


Here's an example of how to use the oembed:
```html
<link rel="alternate" type="application/json+oembed" href="https://api.radio4000.com/oembed?slug=200ok" title="200ok">
```

## Next stuff

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
